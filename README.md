### **ScareLight - Animal Scaring Device**  

**Description:**  
ScareLight is an automatic animal deterrent system designed to keep unwanted animals away using light-based scare tactics. The device uses an **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)** to detect changes in ambient light and triggers a sequence of flashing LED patterns when darkness is detected. These rapid and unpredictable flashes startle animals and discourage them from entering restricted areas such as farms, gardens, or storage spaces.  

### **Key Features:**  
- **Automatic Detection:** The built-in LDR sensor detects changes in light conditions and activates the device only when needed.  
- **Flashing LED Patterns:** A combination of different LED blinking sequences creates a startling effect to deter animals.  
- **Energy Efficient:** Works only in low-light conditions, reducing unnecessary power consumption.  
- **Simple & Effective:** No need for complex setups; just power it up, and it starts working automatically.  
- **Safe for Animals & Environment:** Uses non-harmful light flashes instead of chemicals or loud noises.  

### **Applications:**  
✅ Protects farms from wild animals.  
✅ Prevents stray animals from entering gardens.  
✅ Secures storage areas from unwanted pests.  
✅ Can be used around homes to deter animals at night.
