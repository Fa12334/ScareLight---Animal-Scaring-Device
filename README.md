# ScareLight---Animal-Scaring-Device
ScareLight is an automatic animal deterrent system designed to keep unwanted animals away using light-based scare tactics. The device uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to detect changes in ambient light and triggers a sequence of flashing LED patterns when darkness is detected.
